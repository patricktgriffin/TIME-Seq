# TIME-Seq Sample Processing and Clock Analysis

This github contains example data and code used in Griffin et al. "TIME-Seq Enables Scalable and Inexpensive Epigenetic Age Predictions" (pre-print: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.25.465725).
Here we provide:

(1) The sample processing pipeline for demultiplexing TIME-Seq data from fastq, mapping data, and calling methylation.

(2) Current TIME-Seq clock loci and coefficients.

(3) R code that can be used to analyze TIME-Seq-based epigenetic clocks from bismark-based DNAme data.
